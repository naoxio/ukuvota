### Flutter Version
We tested Flutter as a viable option but decided to go with an Astro + Tauri setup instead. 
[Flutter branch](https://github.com/naoxio/ukuvota/tree/flutter)

### Current Version (Astro + Tauri)
The current version is built with Astro and is being integrated with Tauri for desktop applications. The mobile version is not yet ready.
This version will replace the Flutter version once it's fully developed.
