**UPDATE: We are in the process of rebranding Ukuvota to Evotico and working on a new version that will allow users to create secure processes stored on IPFS.**
**Current working version is still at [ukuvota.world](https://ukuvota.world), to take a look at the current development of the new version take a sneak peak at [evoti.co](https://evoti.co)**
**All data on Ukuvota will be transfered to the new Evotico App once it is production ready**
