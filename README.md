# Ukuvota
## Summary

Ukuvota uses a cooperative and scalable process to help individuals reach collective decisions. The core process is score voting with additional features to make it more cooperative:

    To "keep things the way they are" is always an option, never the default. Framing this option as a default position introduces a significant conservative bias—listing it as an option removes this bias and keeps a collective evolutionary.
    To "look for other options" is always an option. If none of the other current options are good enough, people are able to choose to look for better ones—this ensures that there is always an acceptable option for everyone.
    Every participant can express how much they support or oppose each option. Limiting people to choose their favorite or list their preference prevents them from fully expressing their opinions—scoring clarifies opinions and makes it much more likely to identify the best decision.
    Acceptance (non-opposition) is the main determinant for the best decision. A decision with little opposition reduces the likelihood of conflict, monitoring or sanctioning—it is also important that some people actively support the decision to ensure it actually happens.
