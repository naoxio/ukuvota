**UPDATE: We are in the process of rebranding Ukuvota to Evotico and working on a new version that will allow users to create secure processes stored on IPFS.**

**Current working version is still at [ukuvota.world](https://ukuvota.world), to take a look at the current development of the new version take a sneak peak at [evoti.co](https://evoti.co).**

**All data on Ukuvota will be transfered to the new Evotico App once it is production ready.**

# Evotico
Streamlining secure, efficient electronic voting for organizations and communities, fostering global empowerment.

## Current goals
- [ ] make the form submission to create a process work without JavaScript
- [ ] store data securily in a decentralized database (ipfs?)
- [ ] make proposal collection and voting work without JavaScript
- [ ] migrate data from ukuvota.world and redirect ukuvota to evotico
