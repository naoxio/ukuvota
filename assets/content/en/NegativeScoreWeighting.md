You may optionally increase the impact of negative scores using the negative score weighting. This is a simple mutiplier: x1 has no impact on negative scores, x2 doubles their impact, x3 triples them.

Example: a vote of -3 where there is a negative score weighting of x3 is counted as -9.

By increasing the impact of negative scores, the group moves towards proposals which are more _acceptable_ (less 'negative') than proposals which are more _preferred_ (more net 'positive.')

The 'right' weighting multiplier for your group will probably best be found through experimentation!
