Ukuvota uses a cooperative and scalable process to help individuals reach collective decisions. The core process is <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/score-voting/" target="_blank">score voting</a> with additional features to make it more cooperative:

- **To "keep things the way they are" is always an option, never the default.** Framing this option as a default position introduces a significant conservative bias — listing it as an option removes this bias and keeps a collective evolutionary.

- **To "look for other options" is always an option.** If none of the other current options are good enough, people are able to choose to look for better ones — this ensures that there is always an acceptable option for everyone.

- **Every participant can express how much they support or oppose each option.** Limiting people to choose their favorite or list their preference prevents them from fully expressing their opinions — scoring clarifies opinions and makes it much more likely to identify the best decision.

- **Acceptance (non-opposition) is the main determinant for the best decision.** A decision with little opposition reduces the likelihood of conflict, monitoring or sanctioning — it is also important that some people actively support the decision to ensure it actually happens.
