#### Negativer Score-Gewichtung
Score voting normally values scores as equal increments and chooses the option the highest total score. For example, in a situation where there are three ways to score ('Resist, accept, support') the score values would be -1, 0 and +1. However, on the basis that scoring represents resistance and support, using this equal weighting treats resistance as 'negative support' and selects the option where R < A < S.

The simplest way to select the option where R << A < S is to weight resistance scores more heavily than support scores. Using a weighting factor of 2 would value non-resistance twice as favorably as support. It might be tempting to increase thie weighting factor to something in an attempt to avoid resistance however do so has consequences. If a weighting factor approaches the point where resistance from one individual outweighs all potential support in the group, the voting system degenerates such that only resistance scores carry decision-making value. This potentially denies a supermajority of individuals from pursuing their interests and forces them to vote dishonestly (only in terms of resistance), become more exclusive/exclusionary or leave. So the weighting factor must be greater than 1 and significantly less than the number of individuals. In smaller groups the weighting factor is likely to be higher and in larger groups it is likely to be lower.
