# Intro
Pyramids and smartphones demonstrate what coordination at a massive-scale can achieve. However coordination through hierarchies and markets, as in the case of these examples, tends toward personal relationships based on coercion and competition. 

Relationships based on cooperation are fostered by coordinating through groups and networks. Presently however, coordination through these forms fails to reach the scale required for things like pyramids or smartphones.

How can huge and complicated endeavors be achieved through cooperation? Whilst there is merit in taming hierarchies and markets, this text looks at answering the question by focussing on how collective decision-making, the fundamental coordination process in groups and networks, can be both cooperative and scalable.

Making a decision is a reduction of possible options to probable actions, the eliminative nature of the act being reflected in the origin of 'decision' from latin _decidere_ meaning 'to cut off'. Collective decision-making outlines a process to convert multiple opinions into a single decision, the main variables in the process being 1) the available options 2) how individuals can express their opinions and 3) how opinions are combined and compared. For decision-making to occur there must be at least some will to change from the current state of affairs, the status quo, and at least one alternative. The creative process to make alternatives, proposal-forming, is a prerequisite to decision-making but will not be explored here further since it appears to be a lesser concern for coordination.

# Cooperation
Cooperation is a quality of relationship between individuals that act for their collective-interest. What the collective-interest is and how it can be identified deserve some clarification.

In order to be able to cooperate at all individuals must be self-determined and able to freely associate and dissociate in accordance with their self-interest. Self-interest is taken to be the aggregate of an individuals needs and wants originating from their personal experience of the world. In direct contrast, interactions based on coercion such as threat or force whether perceived or real mask self-interest and self-determined.

Self-determined individuals must treat each other as equals in order to identify the collective-interest. Clearly people are different in countless ways and equality does not mean total symmetry. Equality is specific to that which can be valued equally such as self-interest. The equal combination of individuals self-interests is taken to be the collective-interest. In the case where self-interests are perfectly aligned, acting towards the collective-interest is unsurprising. However cooperation implies the pursuit of collective-interest even when an individual could profit at the collective expense, an illustrative scenario of this being the Prisonners Dilemma. 

The Prisonners Dilemma is a scenario often used in game theory in which two players, who cannot communicate, individually gain various quantities of a reward based on whether they 'cooperate' or 'defect'. It is in their collective-interest to both cooperate and receive six units, three each. However, if player A considers their self-interest to be superior to B's it is in A's self-interest to defect since if B cooperates they receive five units and if B defects they at least get one unit instead of none.

Interactions in collectives are quite different since individuals can communicate before acting and outcomes do not result in the predetermined allocation of comparable units. In order to identify the collective-interest individuals must communicate and compare their interests regarding different outcomes. Opinion differs in polarity and magnitude: positive increments of active support but also in negative increments of active resistance: outcomes without support nor resistance can simply be described as acceptable. Precisely how mixed opinions should be dealt with is the major topic of social choice theory and utilitarian philosophy and cannot possibly be elaborated in detail here. Hopefully the assertion that it is generally more preferable to reduce resistance than increase support is intuitive enough from a personal perspective. To elaboarate this further, support is preferable to acceptance and acceptance is much more preferable than resistance.

In summary, a decision-making process is cooperative if it treats opinions equally and selects the option with Resistance << Acceptance < Support.

# Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a process to accommodate quantity and grow sustainably. In the context of cooperative-decision making this means delivering cooperative decisions whilst simultaneously allowing the collective to grow.

For a collective of any scale to grow, the rate of individuals joining (association) must exceed that of individuals leaving (dissociation). The reason for an individual to associate must be the belief that the collective can more effectively help them fulfill their self-interests. This is the case if an individual has general support for the collective activity. Once associated an individual is likely to develop and fulfill secondary interests, often those of a social nature, providing extra reason to remain associated. The reason for an individal to dissociate from a collective is similar to that for association: the belief that doing so can more effectively help them fulfill their primary self-interests. This is the case if they have acute resistance or persistent absence of support for the collective activity. Taken together, growth - when association exceeds dissociation - is seen to have the same basis has as cooperation: Resistance << Acceptance < Support.

How a collective can act cooperatively (and thus grow) is related to its current scale.

The bottom-up nature of collectives means they typically start at a very small scale of roughly 10 individuals. At this scale individuals can easily socialize and it is possible for all to attend meetings and meaningfully participate. This ability to develop strong social connections and a common mental model of the world leads to comprehensive mutual understanding: individuals can coordinate autonomously by knowing the interests of the others and if resistance does arise, it can often be quickly resolved close to the source. Because of these phenomena it is possible for small-scale collectives to coordinate and make decisions informally. Certain collectives intentionally limit themselves to small-scale precisely to utilize these benefits, including activist 'affinity groups' and software development 'scrum teams'.

As a collective gets bigger, the ability for individuals to socialize or meaningfully participate in meetings rapidly diminishes. Social connections and shared mental models will always exist at a local level but cannot span to a global level due to restrictions in time, space and cognitive capacity. To emphasize this point, in a sufficiently large collective the majority of individuals could never even meet face-to-face. For a large-scale collective to coordinate and make decisions globally, it must use formal and physically decentralized processes.

# Current approaches
Collectives already make decisions, the two most common approaches being majority-rule and unanimous-consent. These approaches are compared with the deifnitions of cooperation and scalability outlined previously.

Majority-rule interprets the principle of quality, that each individuals should be treated equally, to mean that the option most people prefer should be selected. The idea that a minority should have their preference seems superficially counterintuitive and is often thought to be the definition of tyrrany. This approach is classically seen in binary 'yes/no' situations such as referendums where a single proposal is presented and 'yes' stands for its adoption, 'no' for its rejection.

Since an individual can only indicate their comparitive preference, the polarity and magnitude of their self-interest is unknown and as such the expressed collective-interest is misleading. For example a person voting 'yes' might support 'no' only fractionally less and a person voting 'no' might vehemently resist 'yes'. A worst-case scenario can be imagined when an option is selected due to the mild preference of 51 % against the strong preference of the 49 %. In cooperative situations where the minority are not coerced into action, the likelihood of a decision like this being implemented is slim and the number of dissociating individuals high. Additionally, there could be another proposal or compromise that almost the entire voting base would support but they are unable to express this.

Unanimous-consent interprets the principle of equality to mean that no individual should have to endure a decision they strongly oppose. This stems perhaps from a belief in social justice. This approach is commonly seen in deliberative assemblies where proposals are collectively developed through discussion and amendment until no outstanding concerns remain. If concerns do remain, then the proposal is essentially put to a binary decision in which people can express various degrees of support and resistance to the point of veto: if there is no veto the proposal passes.

As for majority-rule, participants can't express that they don't want the status quo nor the proposal. The ability to collectively develop is also a strict limitation to scale. Veto elevates position of those favoring the status quo and introduces vulnerability for saboteurs. Implies belief consensus option exists when in fact none might.

# Elements
# Options
# Include 'Status quo' option
In decision-making where a single proposal <<< commonly in maj and unanim >>> is available there is the appearance of an active option to adopt the proposal and a passive option to not adopt the proposal. However, not adopting a proposal keeps things the way they are which can be reframed actively as maintaining the status quo. In framing the status quo passively against active proposal a conceptual divide is created perhaps to the point of cognitive bias. Presenting the status quo equally alongside proposals removes this conceptual divide and allows individuals to more accurately express their opinions.

Worse than being framed passively is not including the status quo option at all. If a collective gets to the point of actually making a decision then there is clearly some will to change from the status quo. However, the status quo option has the unique property among options of being directly experiential and the outcomes of choosing it being highly predictabile. Not including the status quo option forces individuals away from the outcome they can be most sure of and into change. The status quo is often the most cooperative outcome and should be included on that basis.

# Include 'Find other options' option
Following on from the previous element, a scenario can be imagined where an individual is presented with two options: a proposal which represents a particular change and the status quo which represents no change. With only these options available, an individual who wants change but not the particular change outlined in the proposal cannot express it. A decision made in this case could easily mask resistance.

Whilst a collective is constrained by from trying all possible options due to finite resources, the number of possible options is infinite and the one leading to the most cooperative decision may be among them. As an option this is often negatively formulated as 'none of the above' but it s not clear whether this indicates the will to find other options or abstention. Formulating it positively as 'find other options' unambiguously reveals the stance as active.

Precisely what FOO would entail depends on the situation and corresponding format and would best be predetermined: for small groups it could be a return to discussion, for a large group it could be postponing the decision til next meeting and for a huge network it could be a re-scheduling of the decision with a process of exploration, short-listing...

Including FOO ensure that everyone has an acceptable, positive option. Whilst there options could be actively proposed each time, having them as a formal inclusion is pragmatic and provides a psychological safety net.
	
# Expressions
# Score voting
In order to find the most cooperative solution, the one where resistance << acceptance < support, individuals must be able to fully express their opinions. The formal expression of opinion is called voting regardless of whether the format is hand signals or written paper, from Latin _votum_ "a vow".

Voting by expressing a single, favorite option, as discussed in the examples of majority-rule and unanimous-consent, is called plurality voting. Plurality voting prevents the expression of polarity and magnitude of opinion for the selected outcome and conceals all opinion of the remaining options. The inability to express resistance and support completely obscures the cooperative solution.  

Voting by ranking multiple options to reflect order of preference is called ranked voting. This does allow greater understanding of preference, it still deprives prevents the expression of polarity and magnitude of opinion. For example, in the case of polarity, it is not known at what rank an individual moves from support to resistance; in the case of magnitude, the finishing times in a race between 1st and 2nd place and 2nd and 3rd place could be completely different. Again, the inability to express resistance and support completely obscures the cooperative solution. 

The only way of voting that always allows individuals to express their honest opinions with polarity and magnitude is by giving independent scores. Score voting (a.k.a rating) at its most basic is the expression on each option from three values which is the minimum required to indicate polarity: active support, active resistance and absence of either, acceptance. In order to express magnitude of resistance or support, more than three values are needed with five or seven values being an alright idea. Much above eleven points and people likely to break it down into smaller denominations. Also important to explicitly describe values so people know how to express themselves: pictorally, verbally and numerically.

# Rules
# Score weighting
Score voting normally values scores as equal increments and chooses the option the highest total score. For example, in a situation where there are three ways to score ('Resist, accept, support') the score values would be -1, 0 and +1. However, on the basis that scoring represents resistance and support, using this equal weighting treats resistance as 'negative support' and selects the option where R < A < S.

The simplest way to select the option where R << A < S is to weight resistance scores more heavily than support scores. Using a weighting factor of 2 would value non-resistance twice as favorably as support. It might be tempting to increase thie weighting factor to something in an attempt to avoid resistance however do so has consequences. If a weighting factor approaches the point where resistance from one individual outweighs all potential support in the group, the voting system degenerates such that only resistance scores carry decision-making value. This potentially denies a supermajority of individuals from pursuing their interests and forces them to vote dishonestly (only in terms of resistance), become more exclusive/exclusionary or leave. So the weighting factor must be greater than 1 and significantly less than the number of individuals. In smaller groups the weighting factor is likely to be higher and in larger groups it is likely to be lower.

# General form
The 5 elements discussed above if taken together can be summarised into the following general form:

1. Ballot: Include 'status quo' and 'find other option' alongside proposals.
2. Voting: Score options in a way that differentiates support from resistance.
3. Decision-rule: Select option with highest R << A < S by weighting scores.

# Specific format
To outline a specific format for this general form, imagine a large group (>50) that meets once a month to make decisions. Proposals are developed by individuals and small groups between meetings then presented during meetings. Due to shared vales, unanimous consent for proposal is sought first using a semi-formal, deliberative process. In the case that unanimous consent is deemed unfeasible (e.g. time restrictions, fundamental impasses, etc.) individuals have some way to trigger a formal, decisive process. 

1. Ballot: The proposal(s) outlining changes to the current state of affairs, the following options are also included:
	* Status quo: change nothing and maintain the current state of affairs.
	* NOTA: postpone the decision til the next meeting, forming different proposals in the meantime.
2. Voting: You will have the opportunity to formally express your opinion on each option after it is read in one of three ways: 
	* Resist (-3): you have active resistance towards the option, show with arm-cross <!--PersonGesturingNO-->
	* Accept (0): you have no significant resistance nor support towards the option, show palms together  <!--FoldedHands-->
	* Support (+1): you have active support towards the option, show with raised hands <!--RaisingHands-->
3. Decision-rule: Votes will be tallied for each option and summed given the bracketed values above. The option with the highest sum total will be selected.

# Discussion
Cooperative decision-making can only really survive in a cooperative environment and how that is constructed remains to be seen. One compelling version is a federation of nested collectives. How do important decisions get escalated, especially to the global level? Too many global decisions could lead to fatigue and too few to frustration. How are proposals short-listed for ultimate decision? Too many leads to fatigue and too few to one of the control options. The answer to many of these question undoubtably rests in the creation and use of appropriate web-based or wireless software (free, encrypted and open-source, naturally).
