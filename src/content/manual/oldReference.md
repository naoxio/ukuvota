## Terminology

Consider 'happiness' to roughly mean feeling good and the 'suffering' to roughly mean feeling bad: 'pleasure' and 'pain' could be used instead. For a single aspect of a single person happiness and suffering are considered to be mutually exclusive: the presence of happiness meaning the absence of , but not opposite. In the absence of happiness and suffering a third state of 'acceptance' is considered to roughly mean not feeling bad: 

this can be a passive or active could be thought of passively as the absence of happiness and suffering but is considered here to be an active    In decision-making people express their opinion on options based on how they would expect to feel if that option was selected with 'support' in expecatation of happiness and 'resistance' in expectation of suffering.  'Acceptance' is considered to mean the inverse of

## Introduction

---

Decision-making is the fundamental coordination process people use to collaborate. Well-coordinated collaboration is more efficient through the division of work, specialisation and related phenomena, with increasing efficiencies corresponding to the scale of an organization. However, the efficiency of an organization does not reflect the experience of the collaborators within it: the approach used to coordinate - fundamentally, the approach used in decision-making - both reveals and forms the human relationships between collaborators, whether hierarchical, competitive or cooperative.

### Hierarchical decision-making

Hierarchical decision-making selects options supported by a minority. Hierarchal decision-making, often visualised as a pyramid, takes the decisions are made by those in higher levels - often informally - and the outcomes given to those in lower levels. The success of hierarchies are due to their immediate ability to scale by adding another level or slice to the pyramid. 

> "For the laws of nature (as justice, equity, modesty, mercy, and, in sum, doing to others as we woud be done to) of themselves, without the terror of some power, to cause them to be observed, are contrary to our natural passions, that carry us to partiality, pride, revenge and the like."
>
> -- Thomas Hobbes, 1651, Leviathan.

However as hierarchies scale, the number of levels increases and thus also the gap between the top and the base. Those nearer the top become increasingly disconnected from the people and situations nearer the base, leading them to make decisions which are insensitive, ineffective or inefficient. Those nearer the base become increasingly demotivated on receiving ignorant orders and require some kind of extrinsic force (economic, social or physical) to continue collaborating. Ignorance, the use of force and the slave-master relationship are intrinsic tendencies of hierarchical decision-making. (Much deeper investigation into hierarchies have been done by other, Marx, Engles, Kropotkin, Proudhon, Hobbes, etc) (Some of these tendencies are addressed by rotation of people in positions using periodic representatives (by election or sortition) or liquid delegates.)

### Competitive decision-making

treats people equally, overlooks difference in power pretended to be equal allowed to compete (the weak and few lose)
Focus on support, obscures resistance and tolerance.
zero-sum
waste, deistrust, winner-loser relationship
 
Competitive decision-making selects options supported by a majority. Competitive groups  is also seen directly in groups subscribing to the political philosophy of majoritarianism, which is based on the philosophy of utilitarianism. 

 Competitive groups  This approach is seen indirectly in markets where the majority relates to capital: however with time and the differential accumulation of capital between people, the functioning approach is actually hierarchical and suffers those tendencies.

> "**... it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong...**"
>
> -- Jeremy Bentham, 1776, A Fragment on Government.[^Bentham]

In treating people equally, the natural differences of power overlooked. 

Majoritarianism allows participants to express what they _support_, that is, what would bring them _happiness_: it ignores or obscures _resistance_, that is, what would bring them _suffering_. First-past-the-post or plurality voting, whether by raised hands or paper ballots, is the archetypal majoritarian decision-making process: most other voting systems are also fundamentally majoritarian. Since majoritarianism does not give participants the ability to properly express resistance, options are selected that have the support of some instead of options which the least resist. For minorities, 'losing' a decision is demoralizing and some kind of extrinsic force is often applied to ensure they collaborate. For majorities, 'winning' a decision leads to insensitivity and In order. 

### Cooperative decision making

Groups (networks)
difference in power acknowledged, actively balanced
Focus on acceptance


Cooperative decision-making selects options accepted by the majority. Later reflections on utilitarianism lead to an adaption coined negative utilitarianism:

> "... pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man’s pain by another man’s pleasure. **Instead of the greatest happiness of the greatest number, one should more modestly demand the least amount of suffering for anybody;** and further, that unavoidable suffering should be distributed as equally as possible."
>
> -- Karl Popper, 1947, The Open Society and its Enemies.[^Popper]

Whereas utilitarianism treats suffering and happiness as inverse states, negative utilitarianism treats suffering and happiness as independent states and values not-suffering over happiness leading to intrinsically cooperative governance patterns. (On the basis that one expresses an opinion based upon the state they would anticipate to experience, the expressions 'resistance', 'acceptance' and 'support' are used to prospectively map onto the states of 'suffering', 'not-suffering' and 'happiness'.) 

Whilst hierarchies create formal divisions of power, natural variations between people always exist. The difference then Coordinated collaboration can be achieved competitively, exploiting diversity and concentrating power, or cooperatively, respecting diversity and balancing power. Advantages of the cooperative approach include the resilience of the organization and well-being of the individual. Non-expert participation, whilst a concern for some, does not lead to bad decisions if thought is independent.[^Galton] 

The valuation of non-suffering over happiness can be treated as an absolute or a leaning. Absolute negative utilitarianism (ANU) - not-suffering is infinitely more important than suffering - is reflected in consensus ideology and decision making where maximal/unanimous acceptance is actively sought before considering support. Negative leaning utilitarianism - not-suffering is more important, but not infinitely more important, than happiness.

In organizations where decisions are made by some that affect many and those decisions are implemented using force, as in nation-states currently, the ANU stance may well be most appropriate since happiness cannot be guaranteed and suffering may be forced. However, cooperative associations are the subject of this text, organizations where decisions are made and implemented by those that are affected and implemented without force. In such organizations people choose to join, act and leave.[^d]

Considering cooperative associations, utilitarian governance is limited in that the absence of compromise ignores minority resistance leading to frustration, fragmentation: decreased numbers and a loss of diversity. ANU governance is limited in that total compromise ignores supermajority support leading to frustration, fragmentation: decreased numbers and loss of activists. NLU governance hopefully strikes a balance between the will of the minority and the majority, the individual and the collective.



## 2. Barriers to scale

---

### 2.1. Social connectivity

Social connectivity is often synonymous with trust and therefore cooperation. In smaller groups members have the time and energy to form strong social bonds with other members allowing for the development of coherent mental models and implicit coordination (a.k.a. 'flow'/'magic').[^Espinoza] The value of implicit coordination is evidenced in the Scrum development framework prescribing team sizes between 5 and 12[^Schwaber] and activist affinity groups often being in the range of 5 to 15. 

However, there is a cognitive/physical/temporal limit to the quantity and quality of social connection that any one individual can make - Dunbar famously predicting stable social groups of ~150 for humans in survival conditions.[^Dunbar] Games that scale must tolerate participants who are not socially connected. 

### 2.2. Conversation

Conversation has a strong appeal to humanity as an expressive medium with intrinsic social value. Especially in person (accompanied with body language and tone) but also through other channels (e.g. chat rooms), conversation allows people to interactively exchange and creatively combine complex information. Technologies of amplification and telecommunication overcome the physical restrictions of co-located meeting and voice projection, allowing a single person to be heard by many. However temporal/cognitive restrictions remain, preventing a large number of people from having a meaningful and egalitarian conversation: an hour-long gathering of 6000 people permits each person to speak for 0.6 seconds (meaningless) or for 6 representatives to speak for 10 minutes (hierarchical). 

In groups sufficiently small enough to allow members to have egalitarian conversation, there are still natural variations in language, lexical skill, charisma and speaking duration which create an imbalance of influence: the only natural variation that can be somewhat equalized is the duration of how long people speak (e.g. timed pauses, speaker lists, active facilitation). In social and cooperative groups there is also tendency towards extremism if group members elevate a collective identity over their own individuality ('Groupthink'[^Irving]). Games that scale must not depend on a singular conversation.

### 2.3. Veto 

The veto or block is a powerfully conservative motif giving individuals the ability to stop a new decision from being made: this can be viewed passively as preventing change or actively as choosing the status quo. Historically the reserve of leaders, giving the right of veto to each group member can be interpreted as a supremely egalitarian measure. However, individuals favouring the status quo experience the privileged position of being able to dominate all those in favour of change - perhaps everyone but them self. As group size increases, the likelihood of any option not being vetoed drops to zero leading to stasis. 

Groups that try to maintain veto and avoid stasis do so using subjective restrictions (e.g. 'must contradict group or personal ethics', 'must be reasoned'), objective limits (e.g. 'one veto per person per year') or by tolerating some amount of veto (e.g. 'unanimous acceptance minus one'). Other approaches are to restrict usage to deserving members (introducing a formal power hierarchy) or by making the group more exclusive and/or exclusionary (reducing the group diversity and growth.) Games that scale must bypass the veto.



## 3. General game qualities

---

Based on the previous sections considering cooperativity and scale, the following qualities are deemed necessary for the core elements of any large-scale, cooperative game:

* **Egalitarian.** That participants have equal influence over the outcome, at least that no elements are intrinsically hierarchical.
* **Epistemic.** That the group outcome is reflective of some aggregate of individual opinion, at least that the outcome is not fundamentally misleading.
* **Embracive.** That participants can be different, at least that no elements require uniformity of participants.
* **Participatory.** That those affected are encouraged and enabled to take part, at least that no elements are exclusionary.
  * **Asynchronous.** That participants can take part at different times, at least that no elements require simultaneous participation.
  * **Distributable.** That participants can take part at different places, at least that no elements require simultaneous co-location. 

Whilst every game must requires these qualities for core elements in order to be cooperative, small-scale scenarios may not require an asynchronous and distributable format in order to be participatory (e.g. a housing coop of 10 members.)



## 4. Core game elements

### 4.1. Score voting

Voting: it's a formal decision-making game. express aggregate, select
(not intrsinsically competitive.)
Informal, conversational, meeting, social and ideological doesn't scale.

**Voting allows equal and independent participation at any scale and encourages creativity.**

Voting: it's a formal decision-making game. express aggregate, select
(not intrsinsically competitive.)

Voting can be thought of as a type of game for coordination: participants express their opinions on options, the opinions are combined and an option is selected using a rule. Whilst many voting methods are competitive, gathering criticism from some cooperative groups, competitiveness is not an intrinsic property of all voting implementations. In fact, at scale voting provides the opportunity for equal participation that meeting or conversation based methods can't.  Voting facilitates divergent and free-flowing thought through the creation of separate proposals, instead of iteratively amending a proposal which suffers from anchoring and compromise.

Voting describes any formal decision-making method where participants express their opinions on different options then the opinions expressed are aggregated and an option selected based on certain rules: Voting can be thought of as a game. As such voting formats can be incredibly different, using a variety of expression methods (e.g. raised hands, paper ballots, spoken word, etc). Whilst formats can vary, 

Whilst many voting methods are competitive, gathering criticism from some cooperative groups, competitiveness is not an intrinsic property of all voting implementations. In fact, at scale voting provides the opportunity for equal participation that meeting or conversation based methods can't.  Voting facilitates divergent and free-flowing thought through the creation of separate proposals, instead of iteratively amending a proposal which suffers from anchoring and compromise.

Voting describes a set of coordination games in which individuals express themselves on options, those expressions are aggregated and an option(s) is selected based on the aggregated expressions. Voting has the possibility to be highly scalable, egalitarian and cooperative: whilst many implementations of voting are competitive, gathering criticism from some cooperative groups, competitiveness is not an intrinsic property of voting. Voting facilitates divergent and free-flowing thought through the creation of separate proposals, instead of iteratively amending a proposal which suffers from anchoring and compromise.

In score voting systems (a.k.a 'range' or 'rated' voting) voters express their opinion on options independently using set of values (e.g. 'rate each from 0 to 5'). participants are thus capable of indicating their preference order and preference magnitude. In contrast, rank voting systems (e.g. 'rank from first to last') only allows participants to indicate their preference order and single vote systems (e.g. 'select one') only allows participants to indicate their favourite option (intrinsically competitive). As such score voting systems provide the greatest degree of expressiveness, permitting more honest expression and thus greater trust in the outcome. Further related to expressiveness, score voting systems do not actively encourage manipulation.[^b]

Rank voting and single vote systems force voters into zero-sum comparison of options, for example you cannot rank two options 1st. This leads to the effect of favourite betrayal/compromise, where a voter does not vote for their favourite option (first) as it is not popular and might allow a resisted option being selected. Another negative effect of rank and single vote systems is splitting, where similar options less likely to win by dividing voters.

**Score voting allows participants to express themselves honestly by not incentivising manipulation.**

is the only possibility for voting that is cooperative, since all other types of voting obscure possible compomises and incentivise dishonesty.   is perhaps more commonly known as 'rating', for example film ratings out of 5 stars. 

 There are three main types of system differentiated by how participants can express themselves: single, rank and rating. 

Single vote systems: _'please select one'_. These are the simplest systems with participants only indicating their favorite option. The most well-known version being 'first-past-the-post' or 'plurality', which for many people is synonymous with voting itself. One major flaw is splitting, where similar options divide the voters, thus reducing the chance of either option being selected! Another flaw is compromise - also known as favorite betrayal - where supporters of less popular options vote for an option that is more likely to win in order not to 'waste' their vote. These flaws lead to an incorrect picture of true participant opinion.

Rank voting systems: _'please rank options from first to last'_.  These are the most complex systems, participants indicate their preference order of options, thus also indicating their favorite. Score voting systems allow participants to indicate their preference magnitude, thus also indicating their preference order and their favorite. The differences can be further illustrated with an example

In score voting systems (a.k.a 'range' or 'rated' voting) voters express their opinion on options independently using set of values (e.g. 'rate each from 0 to 5'). participants are thus capable of indicating their preference order and preference magnitude. In contrast, rank voting systems (e.g. 'rank from first to last') only allows participants to indicate their preference order and single vote systems (e.g. 'select one') only allows participants to indicate their favourite option (intrinsically competitive). As such score voting systems provide the greatest degree of expressiveness, permitting more honest expression and thus greater trust in the outcome. Further related to expressiveness, score voting systems do not actively encourage manipulation.[^b]

Rank voting and single vote systems force voters into zero-sum comparison of options, for example you cannot rank two options 1st. This leads to the effect of favourite betrayal/compromise, where a voter does not vote for their favourite option (first) as it is not popular and might allow a resisted option being selected. Another negative effect of rank and single vote systems is splitting, where similar options less likely to win by dividing voters.

### Complete score set

**A complete score set allows participants to fully express themselves by differentiating acceptance from support.**

The value set provided to participants of score voting games prescribes what they can express and participants will express themselves as best they can using the set provided. Using a set that semantically maps onto participant expression is thus important for epistemic reasons. On the basis that support is fundamentally different to resistance - not simply the inverse - a set of at least three values is required: one indicating active resistance (-x), one indicating active support (+x) and a third indicating active acceptance (0) - the state of not supporting nor resisting. Increasing the granularity of expression permits more natural expression, for example by using a 7 point (-3 to +3) set. Whilst it might seem appealing to have very fine granularity (e.g. a 100 point set), there is a cognitive limit to differentiation using sets of much greater than 10 points.[^Miller] Coupling relevant lexical values to numerical values provides a more human understanding of how to score (see Table 1.).

### Acceptance oriented score weighting

**Acceptance oriented score weighting reduces the chance of drag by avoiding options which are resisted.**

Negative leaning utilitarianism (NLU) is the philosophical assertion that not-suffering is more important - but not infinitely more important - than happiness. NLU weighting is achieved by increasing the relative weight of scores indicating resistance. For example, a group considering acceptance three times as important as support could use the following voting scheme: 

| Score (numerical) | Score (lexical) 	| Resistance | Acceptance 	| Support	| Score value 	|
| -- 				| -- 				| -- 	     | --    		| -- 		| --			|
| +3 				| Excellent 		| 0.00 		 | 1.00 		| 1.00  	| +3 			|
| +2 				| Good 				| 0.00 		 | 1.00 		| 0.67  	| +2 			|
| +1 				| Somewhat good 	| 0.00 		 | 1.00 		| 0.33  	| +1 			|
| 0 				| OK 				| 0.00 		 | 1.00 		| 0.00  	|  0 			|
| -1 				| Somewhat bad 		| 0.33 		 | 0.67 		| 0.00  	| **-3**		|
| -2 				| Bad 				| 0.67 		 | 0.33 		| 0.00  	| **-6**		|
| -3 				| Awful 			| 1.00 		 | 0.00 		| 0.00  	| **-9**		|

_Table 1._ An example 7 point set with an NLU weighting factor of 3.

The weighting factor requires deliberation. A weighting factor of 1 equates the importance of acceptance and support - this is a utilitarian and quasi-majoritarian stance which may lead to scenarios where an resisted option is selected over a universally acceptable solution. A weighting factor of infinity only considers the importance of acceptance and ignores support - this is an absolute negative utilitarian and (traditional) consensus stance leading to dishonesty or exclusivity[^a]. A fine line between minority overruling and voter honesty must be walked.

### Control options: 'status quo' & 'none of the above'

**Always including 'status quo' and 'none of the above' as options ensures that every participant always has at least one option they can accept.**

Presenting the 'status quo' as an equal option satisfies the purpose of veto by permitting everyone to express their opinion on keeping things the same - the veto and its conservative privilege are thus superseded. The 'none of the above' option allows people to express their opinion on change even if none of the current proposals are that satisfactory. These options could be actively proposed each time, but including them by habit is pragmatic and provides a psychological safety net.

Including the 'status quo' and 'none of the above' as options on all ballots ensures that every participant always has at least one option they can accept.

The 'none of the above' option allows people to express their opinion on change even if none of the current proposals are that satisfactory. These options could be actively proposed each time, but including them by habit is pragmatic and provides a psychological safety net.

### Open voting

**Open voting eliminates fraud potential and increases participation.**

<!-- Hierarchical cascade is an established mode of operation in which individuals execute orders from their superiors: the top of the pyramid is often a small group of individuals far removed from the experience of those near the bottom. The limitations of this centralised and inherantly dominative/submissive way of working are not seriously inspected here, but include passivation & exploitation of those near the bottom and rigidness & fragility of the organization as a whole. The success of hierarchical organization can be accounted for by its immediate ability to scale: by adding another slice or layer to the pyramid millions can be coordinated to collaborat. This text does not condemn all hierarchies, indeed fluid and rotational representatives can be advantageous, however the focus is on direct representation. -->

## An example game

---

A group of 30 live together in a house which advocates individual autonomy and where autonomy leads to conflict, to find the most cooperative resolution. One member decided to start painting the house green but stopped when others raised concerns. At the next house meeting the subject of painting the house is raised. After some time discussing the subject without finding a solution, one individual proposes to paint it red using the previously agreed trigger phrase, 'I propose...'. A facilitator picks up the cue and proceeds to ask whether anyone has resistance to painting the house red - several indicate that they do by raising a hand. All the identified options are listed: to paint it blue, green or - instead of painting - to create 'living walls' of moss and the control options of 'status quo' (keep things as they are) and 'none of the above' (redecide at the next meeting) are added 

Three signals are in use: 'I resist' indicated by making fists and crossing arms in front of chest, 'I accept' indicated by meeting palms together in front of the chest (prayer-like) and 'I support' indicated by raising both arms straight up. The group previously decided to consider the reduction of resistance with three times the importance of increasing support, leading to the counting scheme:

resist = -3, accept = 0 and support = +1 

The options are read out one by one, with a pause for reflection and then a call for votes to give the following score totals:

* Paint it red: 0
* Paint it blue: 9
* Paint it green: -56
* Create living walls of moss: 15
* Status quo: -20
* None of the above: 20

With the highest score, 'none of the above' is selected, delaying the decision to the next meeting. 'Status quo' scored negatively and much lower than the highest scoring option indicating an independent and energetic will for change. Painting the house green scored very negatively, considerably lower than the status quo, indicating both an independent and relative unpopularity. During the meeting there was a lot of enthusiasm for creating moss walls, reflected by its positive score, however concerns about the technical feasibility could not be resolved with the existing information: the selection of 'none of the above' corresponds with the wish for more research before deciding. Moss walls turned out not only to be feasible, but cheaper and easier than painting - the proposal is passed at the next meeting with high support.

## I. Auxilliary elements

---

### I.I. Lexical triggers

In real-time meetings, whether in person or online, having agreed, clear and unambiguous trigger words and phrases for procedural events reduces confusion and balances influence. Lexical triggers have been used extensively in majoritarian meeting procedures, such as Roberts Rules of Order.[^Robert] Whilst cooperative associations may have shied away from the formality in the past, contemporary consensual meeting procedures such as Consensus Decision Making also utilize lexical triggers.

### I.II Silent hand signals

Silent hand signals for simple and routine information are of great benefit during real-life meetings to allow communication parallel to conversation without disruption, e.g. one hand raised to indicate "I want to speak next". Immortalized by the Occupy movement.

### I.III Creative proposal forming

Creativity is a dependency for identifying widely acceptable and supportable options: the mere fact that a group have to coordinate together implies that no existing options are satisfactory. Many techniques can be used for creative proposal forming whether by individuals, sub-groups or the whole group, so long as affected parties can decide which option they implement.

### I.IV Energy barriers

If any procedure becomes overwhelming, pace can be modified by putting in place some kind of energy barrier. Cooperative barriers must be designed to treat people equally and disregard privilege: economic privilege is still a barrier to participation in many scenarios. In the case of there regularly being too many similar proposals submitted for decision - and thus overwhelming participants - a cooperative barrier could be the 'backing' of proposals by securing the approval of _n_ members.

### I.V Wholeness exercises

People are not robots and cooperative decision making is only one part (albeit a central part) of cooperative culture. 'Wholeness exercises' is used here to broadly describe practices that foster appreciation of individuals, sub-groups and the group. This includes group meditation, sharing circles, affinity groups, retrospectives, reviews, celebrations, etc, etc. If cooperativity does not mean self-sacrifice, it is of utmost importance that cooperative organizations are actively happy.

### (I.VI Transparency

That voters are not anonymous, and individuals are publicly associated with their score. This may in fact be a core element.)



## Notes

---

[^d]: Perhaps this description of an organization is fanciful. What if this organization provides economic security, social connection and existential purpose - what freedom is there to leave if these cannot be fulfilled elsewhere? Still, building better precedes perfection: the life-boats must not sink before others are shown how to build their own. 

[^a]: Consider an open group aspiring to cooperativity in which all voters are honest. High levels of trust and the desire to find universally acceptable solutions leads them to factor acceptance as 100 times more important than support. A member joins who votes manipulatively, voting options that they support less intensely than their favourite with values indicating resistance. For example this member when presented with 5 options, only one of which they actively resist, might vote: (Option 1, supported: +3 (+3)), (Option 2, supported: -1 (-100)), (Option 3, supported: -1 (-100)), (Option 4, accepted: -2 (-200)), (Option 5, resisted: -3 (-300)). The weighting intended to protect minorities from facing outcomes they actively resist is here exploited by a manipulative superminority to dominatively influence their preference of supported options. This would lead to scenarios where outcomes with much less support are selected over options with much greater support that are defeated by manipulation. On the basis that this phenomenon will not be tolerated (for cooperativity is not meekness) and without changing the weighting, it is expected that voters would begin to manipulate in order to indicate their support or that the group becomes more exclusive and exclusionary to avoid and discourage manipulators. Both dishonesty and exclusivity go against the aspiration to cooperativity: reducing the weighting factor may well be the most cooperative correction.

[^b]: "An individual "manipulates" the voting scheme, if, by misrepresenting their preferences, they secure an outcome they prefer to the "honest" outcome - the choice the community would make if the individual expressed their true preferences."[^Gibbard] [De-gendered]

[^c]: Imagine two people, one presently suffering from hunger but soon to eat a meal and another presently satiated after a recent meal but able to enjoy eating more. _If you were able to give a sandwich to the hungry person or the satiated person, what would you choose?_ A utilitarian would be indifferent on the basis that the eater will have happiness increased or suffering decreased by one sandwich and that both situations are therefore equivalent. An absolute negative utilitarian (ANU) or negative leaning utilitarian (NLU) would choose to give the hungry person the sandwich on the basis that reducing suffering is preferable to increasing happiness. _If you were able to give the hungry person a sandwich or the satiated person a life-time supply of food, what would you choose?_ An ANU would still choose to give the hungry person the sandwich on the basis that reducing suffering is always preferable to increasing happiness: a NLU might choose to give the life-time supply to the satiated person on the basis of some internal exchange rate between suffering and happiness. _If you were able to give the hungry person one sandwich or the satiated person two sandwiches, what would you choose?_ The same NLU that previously chose to give the life-time supply of food to the satiated person could very possibly switch to giving the hungry person one sandwich, again based on some internal exchange rate between suffering and happiness.
