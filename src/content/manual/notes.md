description of d-m
	d-m often used to mean foc
	foc = p-f + d-m
	d-m = elimination of options
	
formal decision-making: participants express opinions on options, opinions processed to give a decision
	how participants can express their opinions
	how opinions are processed into decision
		
majority
	proposal presented (binary decision)
	participants express preference
	most preferred option selected
	R/A/S unknown
	WCS: 50 % of collective resists outcome even when a more coop decision exists
	
unanimity
	proposal presented (binary decision)
	creative and dynamic amendment process with mini-decisions to check for resistance
	if consensus cannot be reached participants express support, acceptance, resistance or veto
	if no one vetos, proposal selected
	WCS: 99 % of collective resists outcome (status quo) when more coop decision exists
	
pluralistic ignorance and groupthink are largely similar.
	pluralistic ignorance: majority privately reject norm, incorrectly assume that majority accept norm then publicly accept and promote norm.
	groupthink: desire for harmony and conformity leads to suppression of dissent and irrational/dysfunctional outcomes

vote (n.)
    mid-15c., "formal expression of one's wish or choice with regard to a proposal, candidate, etc.," from Latin votum "a vow, wish, promise to a god, solemn pledge, dedication," noun use of neuter of votus, past participle of vovere "to promise, dedicate" (see vow (n.)). 
    
decision (n.)
    mid-15c., from Middle French décision (14c.), from Latin decisionem (nominative decisio) "a decision, settlement, agreement," noun of action from past participle stem of decidere "to cut off; decide" (see decide). 

scalability (wrt. d-m)
	more individuals associate than dissociate
	small-scale → mental models → informal communication
	large-scale → time, space and brain limits → formal communication
	division of labor and sense of community → incentive to associate
	resisted to decision → incentive to dissociate
	supported or at least accepted decision → incentive to remain associated

Requirements for Elements section
	definition of criteria (coop: equality, A > S; scalable: )
	validation of criteria (why unanimity/majority not scalable/cooperative)

personal blob on groups
	I use the word ‘group’ to mean a conscious and voluntary association of individuals. Instead of group I could say ‘collective’, ‘syndicate’ or ‘association’. If all the associated individuals (members) of a group are gathered in one place, you could refer to them as ‘the group’. However, even if the members are dispersed, you can still make reference to ‘the group’. This is because a group is also an abstraction, often anthropomorphized as a fictional person. This characteristic can be seen in many legal systems where [state compliant] groups are referred to as ‘legal people’ whereas flesh-and-blood humans are referred to as ‘natural people’. Thus a group is ‘greater than the sum of its parts’, both a number of connected Homo sapiens and a collective myth. Collectivity separates a group from a network (swarm, multitude, etc): a group has connectivity between members and a collectivity around a central point whereas networks only have connectivity. The central point of a group is the group itself, meaning anarchy between members: groups in which a subset of the membership are the central point are more easily referred to as hierarchies.
