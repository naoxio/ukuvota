* Target audience: People who don't need to be convinced that the subject is worth thinking about and therefore don't need to be convinced that hierarchies and markets have flaws (i.e. need not fully critique those). Wide range within that field: 
	trad. consensus advocates (Jed) - why not spokes councils?
	near-consensus explorers (Perry, Katie, Joachim) - what is 'near-consensus'?
	social choice theorists (William, Clay) - why trust people?
	anarchist philosophers (Philip, Paul) - avoiding pluralistc ignorance
	people that just want something that works (Matthias, Nick, Bodhi) - an example

* Length: Abooout 10 pages. If it's like-the-best-thing-ever could be longer.

* Tone: Not patronising, academic, exclusive, culty, pally, cold or boring. Friendly and engaging. Something along the lines of the steam employee book or afed membership book.

* Vocab: Accessible whilst being functional. 'Eliminative process' OK, 'temporal spontaneity' not OK.

* Illutrations: yes!
