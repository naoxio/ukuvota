This is a simple multiplier: x1 has no impact on negative scores, x2 doubles their impact, x3 triples them. Example: a vote of -3 where there is a negative score weighting of x3 is counted as -9. By increasing the impact of negative scores, the group moves towards proposals which are more acceptable (less 'negative') than proposals which are more preferred (more net 'positive.'). The 'right' weighting multiplier for your group will probably best be found through experimentation!",
